Description of configuration files:
aliases.txt 
              list of configurations to be used by xdaq
              each alias points to a key number

configuations.txt
              configurations listed by key number
              for each key configurations are fully spec'd
              by name and version number
              e.g. dac 1 refers files in ./dac/1/

calib/
              file specifying calibration sequences
              e.g. pattern of pixels to inject, range of Vcal,
              number of events at each setting

dac/
              file for each module/panel with dac settings
              organized by ROC

detectconfig/
              list of panels/modules to configure
              module names must be found in nametranslation

fecconfig/
              list of pixel fecs in use and VME addresses

fedcard/
              params_fed_N.dat contains all FED parameters
              one such file for each FED in the configuration

fedconfig/
              list of FEDs in use and VME addresses

mask/
              file for each module/panel with pixel mask data
              organized by ROC

nametranslation/
              map from module/panel names to electronics address
              includes control (FEC) addressing and
              readout (FED) addressing

portcard/
              one file for each portcard
              data to be sent via TKFEC to portcards
              (defined by CCU address and I2C channel)
              currently a simple list of address and data

portcardmap/
              mapping from module/panel name to portcard name
              includes AOH channel (1-6)

tbm/
              file for each module/panel with tbm settings

trim/
              file for each module/panel with trim data
              organized by ROC
